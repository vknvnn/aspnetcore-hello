This is the fist day: Hello world about Microservice.

I was created a enviroment that it's a way to study about docker for you.

We have:
1. Asp.net core project.
2. Dockerfile.
3. Deploy the all on your Githup.
4. A Ubutun Server Enviroment to host docker.
    - Install Docker.
5. Pull your source on Ubuntu Server.
6. Run first container on docker.
7. Enjoy.
------------------- End -----------------------


How to use command line on Githup, this is base command line:

1. create a repo on git

2. Get repo

git clone <githup host>

3. (Optional) if you have any change in your project let user the command line bellow to update on your project Githup.

git add .

git commit -m "this is a your command."

git config --global user.email "vokenghiep@gmail.com"

git config --global user.name "Nghiep Vo"

git push

4. If you have any change from other source for your project. let user it to get your new code.

git pull
